Please either open a GitHub issue with this template or email it to pacu@rhinosecuritylabs.com. Please ensure we can understand what the bug is and how to reproduce it. The other details below will assist in getting that point across, though they may not all be required, depending on the information.

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run the command '...'
2. Run the command '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

If applicable/necessary, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Operating System (please complete the following information):**
 - OS + Version: [e.g. Ubuntu 16.04]
 - Python version: [e.g. 3.7]

**Error log**
Most importantly, post the full error stack trace that gets saved to the Pacu folder under `./sessions/[session_name]/error_log.txt`. **Warning:** Pacu tries to scrub sensitive data from the command log and error log, but be sure to comb over what you are posting in case something was missed (which would be something to let us know about as well, so we can fix that in the future). Some data may not necessarily be private, but you may want to remove it anyways, such as your account ID in an ARN or something like that.
